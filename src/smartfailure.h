  Bit 0: Command line did not parse.
  Bit 1: Device open failed, device did not return an IDENTIFY DEVICE structure,
         or device is in a  low-power  mode  (see  '-n'  option above).
  Bit 2: Some  SMART  or other ATA command to the disk failed, or there was a
         checksum error in a SMART data structure (see '-b' option above).
  Bit 3: SMART status check returned "DISK FAILING".
  Bit 4: We found prefail Attributes <= threshold.
  Bit 5: SMART status check returned "DISK OK" but we found that some (usage or
         prefail) Attributes have been <= threshold at some time in the past.
  Bit 6: The device error log contains records of errors.
  Bit 7: The  device  self-test  log  contains records of errors.
         [ATA only] Failed self-tests outdated by a newer successful extended
         self-test are ignored.
